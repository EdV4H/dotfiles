## API Resources

### message

  - `stream` — SendStreamingMessage is a streaming call that will return a stream of task update events until the Task is in an interrupted or terminal state.

### operations

  - `get` — Gets the latest state of a long-running operation. Clients can use this method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API service.

### subscriptions

  - `create` — Creates a Google Workspace subscription. To learn how to use this method, see [Create a Google Workspace subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/create-subscription).
  - `delete` — Deletes a Google Workspace subscription. To learn how to use this method, see [Delete a Google Workspace subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/delete-subscription).
  - `get` — Gets details about a Google Workspace subscription. To learn how to use this method, see [Get details about a Google Workspace subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/get-subscription).
  - `list` — Lists Google Workspace subscriptions. To learn how to use this method, see [List Google Workspace subscriptions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/list-subscriptions).
  - `patch` — Updates or renews a Google Workspace subscription. To learn how to use this method, see [Update or renew a Google Workspace subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/update-subscription).
  - `reactivate` — Reactivates a suspended Google Workspace subscription. This method resets your subscription's `State` field to `ACTIVE`. Before you use this method, you must fix the error that suspended the subscription. This method will ignore or reject any subscription that isn't currently in a suspended state. To learn how to use this method, see [Reactivate a Google Workspace subscription](https://developers.google.com/workspace/events/guides/reactivate-subscription).

### tasks

  - `cancel` — Cancel a task from the agent. If supported one should expect no more task updates for the task.
  - `get` — Get the current state of a task from the agent.
  - `subscribe` — TaskSubscription is a streaming call that will return a stream of task update events. This attaches the stream to an existing in process task. If the task is complete the stream will return the completed task (like GetTask) and close the stream.
  - `pushNotificationConfigs` — Operations on the 'pushNotificationConfigs' resource

Before calling any API method, inspect it:

```bash
# Browse resources and methods
